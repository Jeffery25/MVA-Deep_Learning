    "```position``` records the position of the rat. It is a 2D grid of 0s except for the spots corresponding to places beyond the game board boundaries (which are set to $-1$) and the current position of the rat (set to $1$). The boundaries are to account for the fact that the rat can see two squares away. Later on we will keep track of the squares previously visited in this array, but not for the moment.\n",

    "```board``` keeps track of the rewards awaiting the rat. It is a 2D grid of 0s except for squares containing bonuses (cheese) which are set to $0.5$ and those containing maluses (poison) which are set to $-1$. Both bonuses and maluses appear with a probability equal to the value of ```temperature```, and a spot on the board cannot contain both cheese and poison. When the rat passes on a spot, the reward is collected and set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we edited the code in several places: \n",
    "* a bug was fixed when setting the boundaries in ```position``` to $-1$. (```self.position[:,-2:] = -1``` instead of ```self.position[-2:,:] = -1```, which was already stated)\n",
    "* another minor bug was fixed in the ```reset()``` method when instantiating the position of the rat: the upper boundary of ```np.random.randint()``` was incremented as it is exclusive.\n",
    "* the long ```np.concatenate()``` statement in the definition of ```state``` was replaced by a more concise call to ```np.dstack()```\n",
    "* the colors of the grid for the videos were changed to be a bit more evocative\n",
    "* many comments were added + a few small style changes\n",
    "* a penalty for trying to go off the island is added (we later notice that the rat often oscillates at the island border, so this is to avoid this)"

    "__Part 1__: From the definition further up of the Action-Value function $Q^\\pi$ of policy $\\pi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q^\\pi(s,a)=E_{p^{\\pi}}\\left[\\sum_{t\\leq T}\\gamma^{t}r(s_{t},a_{t})|s_{0}=s,a_{0}=a\\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can increment the $t$ and correspondingly remove a $\\gamma$ factor without changing things:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q^\\pi(s',a')=\\frac{1}{\\gamma} E_{p^{\\pi}}\\left[\\sum_{1\\leq t\\leq T}\\gamma^{t}r(s_{t},a_{t})|s_{1}=s',a_{1}=a'\\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We now take the first equation again and separate the first term from the summation and use linearity of expectation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q^\\pi(s,a)=E_{p^{\\pi}}[r(s, a)] + E_{p^{\\pi}}\\left[\\sum_{1\\leq t\\leq T}\\gamma^{t}r(s_{t},a_{t})|s_{0}=s,a_{0}=a\\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we use the Markov property to remove $a_0$ and $s_0$ from the equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "__Part 2__: $Q^{*}(s,a)$ refers to our expected return if:\n",
    "* we first take action $a$ \n",
    "* we subsequently choose only optimal actions defined as $a^* = \\text{argmax}_{a'} Q^{*}(s',a')$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly $\\max_{a'} Q^{*}(s',a')$ refers to our expected return if we start straight away with an optimal action and continue choosing optimal actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So finding $Q^{*}(s,a)$ is the same as:\n",
    "* finding our first expected reward $E[r(s,a)]$\n",
    "* receiving the next state $s'\\sim \\pi^*(.|s,a)$ \n",
    "* given $s'$ finding the expectation if we only take optimal actions—i.e. adding $\\max_{a'} Q^{*}(s',a')$\n",
    "* adding the expectation from the line above to our result once multiplied by the time discount factor $\\gamma$ \n",

    "In one formula, we get the desired result:\n",

    "$$ Q^{*}(s,a)=E_{s'\\sim \\pi^*(.|s,a)}\\left[r(s,a)+\\gamma\\max_{a'}Q^{*}(s',a')\\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Part 3__: Ideally our loss would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\Vert Q^*(s,a) - Q(s, a, \\theta)\\Vert^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But that would of course assume we already know $Q^*(s,a)$. But if we suppose the above for an instant and use our previous result, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)=E_{s' \\sim \\pi^*(.|s,a)}\\Vert r + \\gamma\\max_{a'}Q^*(s',a')-Q(s,a,\\theta)\\Vert^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the closer we get to $Q(s,a,\\theta) = Q^*(s,a)$, the closer we get to our actual loss function below being zero:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)=E_{s' \\sim \\pi^*(.|s,a)}\\Vert r+\\gamma\\max_{a'}Q(s',a',\\theta)-Q(s,a,\\theta)\\Vert^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that no other function than $Q^*(s,a)$ can bring the above to 0 since there is only one fixed point to the _Optimal Bellman Equation_. Hence this loss function is quite plausible."

    "Both agents we have trained fall into a problematic _local minimum_: they eventually start oscillating back and forth or turning in circles, meaning they do not explore enough. Indeed going onto unknown ground contains more risk than gain (poison gives a bigger penalty than cheese gives as a bonus), so the agent decides to stick to places it knows. This can be fixed by implementing the memory of visited places seen in the next part.\n",

    "When we raise the temperature, the agent is surrounded with cheese and has much less trouble winning ; but when the rewards are sparser, being disinclined to explore, the agent does not go very far.\n",

To improve this, instead of giving the rat a fixed penalty for going on a square it already visited (as suggested), we made the penalty proportional to the number of times the rat has visited the square: turning in circles is now a heavily penalized startegy.\n",

If it were much lower our rat would have to end up choosing poison over seeing the same squares again, so our implementation would have to be modified again."
